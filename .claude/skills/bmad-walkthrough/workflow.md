Guide a human review of a target, one block at a time. They may
stop to inspect, edit, or test. Keep track of which blocks the
user has called done. A block or the review as a whole is done
only when the user says it is.

# Terms

- **Target:** The commit, PR, file, or directory being reviewed.
- **Review:** The session. Done when the user says it is.
- **Block:** One slice of the walkthrough. Accepted only when the user
  says so.
- **Review narrative:** The human-facing writeup. Organized in blocks.
  Owns block review status.
- **Review log:** Append-only record of review activities and outcomes.
- **Finding:** A concrete issue from inspection.
- **Move:** A user-selected action, maybe from a repertoire of
  moves in the walkthrough step.

# Human attention is scarce

Show only what a human needs to see. Do not distract them. Write
the log, edit the narrative, look things up, reason — but do not
put it in the session.

When subagents are available, spawn a cheap background one for
writing log and narrative files. Doing that work in the main
session distracts the user.

# Write for a human

The session output and the review narrative file are for a human.
Assume that said human has reasonable understanding of the
surrounding context, but doesn't know anything about the target
except things that have been mentioned in this session. Leave the
brief log style to the log.

# Clickable file refs

Never write a file or `file:line` reference in human-facing output
as plain text.

In the review narrative file, every file and `file:line` must be a
markdown link relative to that file (`[label](../src/foo.ts)`).

In the session, never write a markdown link. Use a form the host
can click: a Cursor code citation (`startLine:endLine:path` on the
opening fence); a VS Code `#file:path`; or a CWD-relative
`path:line` with no leading `/`. If unsure, use `path:line`.

# Block shapes

**Intent** (block 1). What the change is for and why it exists now.
If you found a target plan file with an intent section, paste it
verbatim. Otherwise generate from what you know about the target, no
more than 300 tokens. Include a short note on where you got it from.

**Broad strokes** (block 2). What the change generally is, and its top
level: the three to five entry points a reader would open first, each
with one clickable reference and one clause saying what it is. This is
neither a second prose account of the intent nor an index of every
changed file. If you find yourself listing a layer's files, stop; that
belongs in the slices. Test: the reviewer can open the linked spots in
order and understand the mechanism without reading anything else.

**Slices** (middle blocks). One concern per block, not one file. Lead
with the mechanism in two or three sentences, then the specific places
with references.

For a simple change applied to a large number of files, group the
files by how they were changed (one or several groups). Treat each
group as a slice: one or two worked examples, plus a clickable list
of the rest that got the same treatment.

**Periphery** (last block). Docs, build registration, small enablers.
References only, one clause each.

{% if workflow.on_activation %}
# On Activation

{{ workflow.on_activation }}
{% endif %}
{% if workflow.persistent_facts %}
# Persistent facts

Do not compact these away. Load `file:` paths. Expand globs and read
every match. Other entries are facts.

{{ workflow.persistent_facts }}

{% endif %}
# Workflow

`{active_initiative}` is the value printed by
`uv run {project-root}/_bmad/scripts/resolve_config.py --project-root {project-root} --key core.active_initiative`,
read once before step 1. When it is unset, drop `/{active_initiative}`
from every path.

Follow the step files in order. Read one step fully, execute it, then
load the next step only when directed. Do not skip, reorder, or
pre-load steps.

# FIRST STEP

Read fully and follow: `{{ rendered("step-01-orientation.md") }}` to begin.
