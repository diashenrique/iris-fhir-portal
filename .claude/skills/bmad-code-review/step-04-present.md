# Step 4: Present and Act

## RULES

- When `{plan_file}` is set, always write findings to it before offering action choices.
- `decision-needed` findings must be resolved before handling `patch` findings.
- Never change a plan's `status`. The build leaves it at `built`; only the user marks a ticket done.

## INSTRUCTIONS

### 1. Clean review shortcut

If zero findings remain after triage (all rejected or none raised): state that. When `{plan_file}` is set, still write section 2's block, with the summary line and the `Rejected` appendix, so the run is recorded. Then proceed to section 6 (Next steps).

### 2. Write findings to the plan

If `{plan_file}` is set, append a block to its `## Code Review` section, creating that section at the end of the file when it is absent. The block opens with `### {date}` and the summary line from section 3, then the findings below, then the `Rejected` appendix. Write all findings in this order:

1. **`decision-needed`** findings (unchecked):
   `- [ ] [Review][Decision] <Title> — <Detail>`

2. **`patch`** findings (unchecked):
   `- [ ] [Review][Patch] <Title> [<file>:<line>]`

3. **`defer`** findings (checked off, marked deferred):
   `- [x] [Review][Defer] <Title> [<file>:<line>] — deferred: <pre-existing, or for maybe-false the evidence that would settle it>`

Also append each `defer` finding to `{deferred_work_file}` under a heading `## Deferred from: code review ({date})`. If `plan_file` is set, include its basename in the heading (e.g., `code review of story-digest-delivery-plan (2026-03-18)`). One bullet per finding with description.

### 3. Present summary

Announce what was written:

> **Code review complete.** <D> `decision-needed`, <P> `patch`, <W> `defer`, <R> rejected.

The `Rejected` appendix is one line per rejected finding: `false` with its refutation, `low` with why it was not worth fixing. Without `plan_file`, it ends the chat listing.

If `plan_file` is set, add: `Findings written to {plan_file}.`
Otherwise add: `Findings are listed above. No plan was provided, so nothing was persisted.`

### 4. Resolve decision-needed findings

If `decision_needed` findings exist, present each one with its detail and the options available. The user must decide — the correct fix is ambiguous without their input. Walk through each finding (or batch related ones) and get the user's call. Once resolved, each becomes a `patch`, `defer`, or is rejected.

If the user chooses to defer, ask: Quick one-line reason for deferring this item? (helps future reviews): — then append that reason to both the finding's bullet in `{plan_file}` and the `{deferred_work_file}` entry.

**HALT** — I am waiting for your numbered choice. Reply with only the number. Do not proceed until you select an option.

### 5. Handle `patch` findings

If `patch` findings exist (including any resolved from section 4), HALT. Ask the user:

If `plan_file` is set, present all three options:

> **How would you like to handle the `<P>` `patch` findings?**
> 1. **Apply every patch** — fix all of them now, no per-finding confirmation. Defer and decision-needed items are not touched.
> 2. **Leave as action items** — they are already in `{plan_file}`
> 3. **Walk through each patch** — show details for each before deciding

If `plan_file` is **not** set, present only options 1 and 2 (omit "Leave as action items" — findings were not written to a file):

> **How would you like to handle the `<P>` `patch` findings?**
> 1. **Apply every patch** — fix all of them now, no per-finding confirmation. Defer and decision-needed items are not touched.
> 2. **Walk through each patch** — show details for each before deciding

**HALT** — I am waiting for your numbered choice. Reply with only the number. Do not proceed until you select an option.

- **Apply every patch**: Apply every patch finding without per-finding confirmation. Do not modify defer or decision-needed items. After all patches are applied, present a summary of changes made. If `plan_file` is set, check off the patch items in it (leave defer items as-is).
- **Leave as action items** (only when `plan_file` is set): Done — findings are already written to `{plan_file}`.
- **Walk through each patch**: Present each finding with full detail, diff context, and suggested fix. After walkthrough, re-offer the applicable options above.

  **HALT** — I am waiting for your numbered choice. Do not proceed until you select an option.

**✅ Code review actions complete**

- Decision-needed resolved: <D>
- Patches handled: <P>
- Deferred: <W>
- Rejected: <R>

### 6. Next steps

Present the user with follow-up options:

> **What would you like to do next?**
> 1. **Build the next ticket** — run `bmad-build` to pick up the next ready ticket
> 2. **Re-run code review** — address findings and review again
> 3. **Done** — end the workflow

**HALT** — I am waiting for your choice. Do not proceed until the user selects an option.
