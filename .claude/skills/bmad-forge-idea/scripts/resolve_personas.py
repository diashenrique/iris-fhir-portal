"""Resolve the personas and parties the forge can bring into the room.

The forge cross-examines witnesses: the installed BMAD agents, plus any
custom personas and party groups the user has authored for `bmad-party-mode`.
This surfaces all of them in one shot so the orchestrator never has to ask
"who's available?" — it just intermixes whoever fits the branch, alongside
any persona the user names on the fly.

What it returns (JSON, stdout):
  * agents   — the installed BMAD roster: the default room, always present.
  * members  — extra personas in the pool: guests an installed module's
               roster offers, and party_members the user defined that
               aren't already an installed slot.
  * parties  — the named party groups, an installed module's first and then
               the user's, members resolved to brief entries; open-cast
               groups (scene names a pool, no roster) are flagged.
  * default_party — the group id pinned as party-mode's default, if any.

Discovery is best-effort and never blocks the forge. The installed roster
comes from `_bmad/scripts/roster.py`, the same source `bmad-party-mode` uses,
so both skills see the same room; the `[agents]` table of the central config
is the fallback for a project set up before rosters existed. Custom personas/parties come from
`bmad-party-mode`'s resolved customization when that skill is found beside
this one, else from the user's override TOMLs read directly. Anything that
can't be resolved is simply omitted and flagged, never fatal.
