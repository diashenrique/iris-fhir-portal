# BMad Method knowledge

This document covers the skills of the `method` module: what each one gives the user, when to recommend it, and what to offer next.

## How the method works

The method turns an intent of any size into working software. Recommend the smallest path that safely fits the work; never march the user through every skill. A project may hold only some of these skills: recommend from what is installed, and say plainly when a step has no installed skill rather than inventing a substitute.

**`bmad-spec` is the hub.** It condenses any input, at any altitude, into a spec folder: `spec-<slug>.md` plus companion files, the contract every build reads. A user can talk to it directly. Every analysis and planning skill exists to give the user better material to feed into a spec, and they can run in any order, before or after the spec exists, because the spec is re-derived from a running log and never hand-merged. After any of them finishes, the usual next step is to fold its result into the spec with `bmad-spec`.

The four phases are analysis (ideation, research, is it worth building), planning (what exactly, and in what slices), implementation (build it), and validation (is it right). They describe what kind of help a skill gives. They are not a mandatory sequence to complete.

Project size decides how many build sessions the work needs. Stakes decide how heavy the planning gets. A large hobby project keeps planning light; a small change to a regulated system may not.

## More detail

This document should be enough to route the user and say what to do next. Each topic file below sits in this folder and goes deeper on one subject. Read one only when the question is about that subject, using the path the knowledge script lists for it.

| Topic file | Read when the user asks about |
|---|---|
| `help/analysis-skills.md` | `bmad-product-brief` or `bmad-prfaq` in depth: what each gives, when to pick it, when not to, how they relate. |
| `help/planning-skills.md` | `bmad-spec`, `bmad-prd`, `bmad-ux`, `bmad-architecture`, `bmad-ticket` in depth. |
| `help/implementation-skills.md` | `bmad-build`, `bmad-build-auto`, or `bmad-correct-course` in depth. |
| `help/validation-skills.md` | `bmad-code-review`, `bmad-walkthrough`, `bmad-qa-generate-e2e-tests`, or `bmad-retrospective` in depth. |
| `help/prototyping.md` | Prototyping or vibe coding first, what a prototype is good for (worth doing, feasibility, complexity, unknowns), non-engineers prototyping, what to do with a prototype afterwards, whether planning still matters after a good first version. |
| `help/existing-codebase.md` | Using BMad on an inherited, brownfield, or long-lived codebase. |
| `help/preparing-a-repo-for-agents.md` | Getting a codebase ready for agentic coding, inconsistent agent output, how much documentation to keep (small ADRs, not heavy docs), regular refactoring, holding quality over time. |
| `help/artifact-lifetime.md` | Whether to keep PRDs, specs, stories, and build records after the work is done, archiving, closing out an epic, keeping old plans from misleading agents. |
| `help/monorepo-and-polyrepo.md` | Where to install BMad and keep planning when work spans one repository or several; the workspace layout for a poly repo. |
| `help/working-in-an-organization.md` | A team or enterprise: an existing PRD, Jira or another tracker, approvals and sign-off, document owners, several engineers in parallel, requirements changing mid-flight. |
| `help/ticketing-and-epics.md` | How `bmad-ticket` works (initiatives, epic inception, the breakdown, building from an entry, refining), plan status, review, and retrospective. |
| `help/ticketing-setup.md` | Setting up and driving `bmad-ticket`: the store, several repos, trackers, the phrases to say, the hand-off to `bmad-build`. |
| `help/unattended-builds.md` | `bmad-build-auto`, building stories with no human present, a blocked run and how to retry, what to check after a run. |
| `help/review-choices.md` | Review depth, skipping review, another review pass, when to stop, slow reviews, customizing review. |
| `help/project-context.md` | `bmad-project-context` in depth: what belongs in `AGENTS.md`, why the block is small, its intents, removing a rule. |

## Start here

- Can one session understand, build, review, and finish it?
  - Obvious and low-risk (typo, formatting, config): just make the edit. No skill.
  - Yes → `bmad-build`. No planning skill first.
- Bigger than one session: does the user already have enough to say or paste (an idea they can explain in detail, notes, intent.md, single ticket, a transcript, a brief, a PRD)?
  - Yes → `bmad-spec`, then `bmad-ticket` with the spec folder to plan the stories. Then one `bmad-build` per story.
  - No → find what is missing, run the skill that supplies it, then `bmad-spec`:
    - They cannot name a customer or a problem → `bmad-forge-idea` or `bmad-brainstorming` (core tools), if installed.
    - Unsure the idea is worth building → `bmad-prfaq`.
    - Sure of the idea, but it is not written down or not shareable → `bmad-product-brief`. It is also the lighter choice when a full PRD is more than the work needs.
    - Requirements need real detail, or many stakeholders, compliance, or integrations are involved → `bmad-prd`.
    - The look and feel matter, or the user thinks best in screens and flows → `bmad-ux`. Starting with UX is a normal way in.
    - Separate people, agents, or sessions could build parts that do not fit together → `bmad-architecture`.
- Wants to prototype first, or is unsure the work is worth doing, feasible, or how complex it is → encourage a prototype. It suits enterprise work as much as hobby work, greenfield or existing code, and non-engineers can build one. A throwaway needs no skill. Afterwards the user decides to throw it away or keep it, and either way what it taught them goes into `bmad-spec` (`help/prototyping.md`).
- Risk, unclear requirements, architectural reach, or coordination between people push work up a tier even when it is small.

## Match the situation

Situations the tree above does not settle.

| The user says or has | Recommend | Because |
|---|---|---|
| "I want to start from the design" | `bmad-ux` | UX may lead. Feed its files to `bmad-prd` when requirements still need drawing out, to `bmad-product-brief` for a lighter write-up, or straight to `bmad-spec` when they say enough. |
| A prototype, and asks what now | Decide: throw away or keep | Thrown away, the notes go to `bmad-spec`. Kept, treat it as an existing codebase (`help/prototyping.md`). |
| Work spans several repositories | Install BMad at a workspace root that holds them all, with planning kept there | One session then reaches the plan and every project (`help/monorepo-and-polyrepo.md`). |
| "How do I get my repo ready for AI agents?", or agents keep producing inconsistent work | Consistent patterns, a good initial `AGENTS.md`, end-to-end tests, and cleanup first when quality is low | Agents copy what they find (`help/preparing-a-repo-for-agents.md`). |
| "Do I keep the PRD, spec, and stories once it is built?" | Keep joined plans and their evidence | Plans own live ticket state; scope routine reads to the active initiative (`help/artifact-lifetime.md`). |
| An inherited or brownfield codebase | A small `bmad-build` change first; `bmad-project-context` and `bmad-walkthrough` as needed | No up-front documentation pass is required (`help/existing-codebase.md`). |
| "I don't know architecture, stacks, or hosting" | `bmad-architecture`, or the architect agent to talk it through | It coaches, recommends a current starter, and lays out options with reasons for the user to choose. Technical knowledge is not needed to start. |
| "An app for X" and nothing more | `bmad-product-brief`, or `bmad-prd` when the stakes call for full requirements | `bmad-spec` distills and will not coach; the input is too thin for it. The brief is the lighter of the two. |
| A PRD and architecture, several epics, wants tracking | `bmad-ticket` | One tree of epics, entries, and joined plans. |
| A team with an existing PRD, a tracker, approvals, or several engineers | The full path only when approvers, parallel teams, or required documents call for it | The existing PRD is input, each document has one owner, and sign-off attaches to skill results (`help/working-in-an-organization.md`). |
| "Can BMad build my stories by itself?" | `bmad-build-auto`, dispatched per story by a loop | It suits settled decisions and well specified stories, with someone reading the results. For work planned with `bmad-ticket`, give it the ticket, one run per ticket (`help/unattended-builds.md`). |
| Wants tickets or a tracker (Jira, Linear, GitHub) as the record | `bmad-ticket` | Tickets are the board. The build moves a ticket's `status` in its plan as far as `built`, and the user marks it done. |
| "Where are we?" | `bmad-ticket` status | Reads the ticket tree and joined plan statuses. |
| A v6 project (`epics.md`, `sprint-status.yaml`, dated folders under the planning folder) that wants the v7 layout | `bmad migrate method` | The module ships `migration-1.toml`: the rules for moving the project's artifacts into initiative folders, turning epics and sprint status into a ticket tree, and putting loose work in `inbox/`. The `bmad` skill plans it with the user, then performs it. |
| A PR, a branch, a ticket in review, or code `bmad-build` did not write | `bmad-code-review` | Agent lenses over any diff. With no argument it offers the tickets in review. |
| "Walk me through what changed" | `bmad-walkthrough` | The human is the reviewer. |
| Every ticket of an epic is built, done, or dropped | `bmad-retrospective` | It judges the whole against the epic's Done when and the initiative's requirements. |
| A big change surfaced mid-build | A spec-only change: update through `bmad-spec`. Otherwise `bmad-correct-course`. | Correct course needs a PRD or a spec and halts when it has neither. The user describes the affected epics and stories. |
| Wants an expert to think a phase through with, or is unsure where to begin in it | The agent for that phase (see "The agents") | It guides across turns and runs the phase's skills from its menu. |
| Agents keep making the same mistake in this repo | `bmad-project-context` | It records the rule in `AGENTS.md`. |

## The skills

One line per skill: what it is for and what it writes. The files it writes are how to tell what is already done. Paths are in the active initiative's folder, `{output_folder}/{active_initiative}/`, or in `{output_folder}/` when none is active; each document is a `<type>-<slug>/` folder holding `<type>-<slug>.md`. When none is active, `bmad-product-brief`, `bmad-prd`, `bmad-ux`, `bmad-architecture`, `bmad-spec`, and `bmad-correct-course` hand off to the `bmad` skill to set one; `bmad-brainstorming`, `bmad-deep-recon`, `bmad-forge-idea`, `bmad-prfaq`, `bmad-party-mode`, and `bmad-build` ask once per session whether the work belongs to one; the rest write to `{output_folder}/`. Showing, switching, creating, or clearing the active initiative is a `bmad` request. `planning_artifacts` and `implementation_artifacts` are no longer read; a v6 project moves its files with `bmad migrate method`. Open the phase file for the full picture of a skill: what it gives, when to pick it, when not to.

| Skill | For | Writes |
|---|---|---|
| **Analysis** (`help/analysis-skills.md`) | | |
| `bmad-product-brief` | A 1-2 page brief of a product the user believes in. Lighter than a PRD, sharper than a hand-written intent file. It does not judge the idea. | `brief-<slug>/brief-<slug>.md` |
| `bmad-prfaq` | Tests whether a concept survives scrutiny: press release, hard FAQs, researched claims, a verdict. | `prfaq-<slug>/prfaq-<slug>.md`, plus `-distillate.md` beside it |
| **Planning** (`help/planning-skills.md`) | | |
| `bmad-spec` | The hub. Distills any input into the contract builds read, and updates it. It does not slice or coach; splitting work into stories is `bmad-ticket`. | `spec-<slug>/spec-<slug>.md` and companions |
| `bmad-prd` | Coaches detailed requirements out of the user, sized to the stakes. Also updates and validates a PRD. | `prd-<slug>/prd-<slug>.md` |
| `bmad-ux` | How the product looks and works. May lead, follow, or stand alone. Can produce mocks and wireframes. | `ux-<slug>/` with `DESIGN.md`, `EXPERIENCE.md`, and `ux-<slug>.md` naming them |
| `bmad-architecture` | Settles only the decisions that keep separately built parts consistent. Coaches a user with no architecture knowledge, recommends a current starter, and covers hosting and deployment. | `architecture-<slug>/architecture-<slug>.md` |
| `bmad-ticket` | Plans initiatives, epics, and stories as a ticket tree and runs it as a board: ready, next, blocked, done. Stories are entries in `tickets.toml`; a file is written only when one is reviewed, refined, or published. Bugs go to `backlog/`. Optional tracker. | The ticket tree under `{output_folder}/{active_initiative}/`, plus `{output_folder}/backlog/` |
| **Implementation** (`help/implementation-skills.md`) | | |
| `bmad-build` | One session of delivery: clarifies intent, plans, implements, reviews, commits. The default for any real change. Takes free text, a ticket from the tree (nothing means the next ready one), or any file as intent. | A ticket's plan beside `tickets.toml`, or `plan-<slug>.md`; `deferred-work.md` |
| `bmad-build-auto` | One unattended build of one ticket, dispatched by a loop or script. Never for attended work. | The same plans as `bmad-build` |
| `bmad-correct-course` | Assesses a significant midstream change. Needs a PRD or a spec; lists epic and story changes for `bmad-ticket`. | `change-<slug>/change-<slug>.md` |
| **Validation** (`help/validation-skills.md`) | | |
| `bmad-code-review` | Agent review of any diff, PR, or branch, with triaged findings. Redundant right after a thorough `bmad-build` review of the same change. | A dated block in the plan's `## Code Review` section, or chat |
| `bmad-walkthrough` | The human reviews a change block by block, guided. Also a way to learn unfamiliar code. | `walkthrough-<slug>/` with the narrative and a `-log.md` |
| `bmad-qa-generate-e2e-tests` | API and end-to-end tests for features that already exist. | `{project-root}/tests`, `test-summary-<slug>/test-summary-<slug>.md` |
| `bmad-retrospective` | Judges a finished epic folder in the ticket tree as a whole against its Done when. | `epic-<slug>-retrospective.md` in the epic folder |
| **Any time** (`help/project-context.md`) | | |
| `bmad-project-context` | Keeps a small, verified block of rules for agents. Use it when an agent got something wrong in this repo, a repo has no usable `AGENTS.md`, or the stack was just decided. It gives no repo overview. | `{project-root}/AGENTS.md` |

### Slicing and tracking the work

`bmad-ticket` plans and tracks work in one ticket tree. An initiative holds epics; each epic's `tickets.toml` holds ordered entries. Build an entry directly without making a story file. Standalone stories and bugs can be direct intent or backlog leaves. Plans own status and remain live after completion. Builds stop at `built`; the user or orchestrator marks `done`. See `help/ticketing-setup.md`.

### Who reviews what

| | Reviewer | Looks at | Fixes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Review inside `bmad-build` | Agents | The change just built | Clear findings, itself |
| `bmad-code-review` | Agents | Any diff, PR, branch, or commit | What the human chooses |
| `bmad-walkthrough` | The human, guided | A commit, PR, file, or directory | Nothing unless asked |
| `bmad-retrospective` | Agents, across tickets | A whole epic folder | Nothing; proposes action items |

## The agents

Five named experts, each owning a phase and staying in the conversation across turns. An agent carries its role's judgment, offers a menu of the skills it owns, and helps the user decide what to do and why before and between skill runs. Offer one whenever the user wants an expert to work with rather than a single skill to run, is unsure where to begin in a phase, or likes the experience of interacting with unique personas. In the future these agents will have the ability to retain memory and work autonomously which is why they are still a core part of the project.

| Agent | Phase | Work with them to |
|---|---|---|
| Mary, analyst — `bmad-agent-analyst` | Analysis | Brainstorm, research a market, domain, technology, or competitor, then shape a brief or a PRFAQ. |
| John, product manager — `bmad-agent-pm` | Planning | Turn a vision into a PRD, epics and stories, check readiness, and handle a midstream change. |
| Sally, UX designer — `bmad-agent-ux-designer` | Planning | Work out how the product looks and behaves. |
| Winston, architect — `bmad-agent-architect` | Planning | Settle the technical decisions that keep the parts consistent, and check readiness. |
| Amelia, developer — `bmad-agent-dev` | Implementation and validation | Build stories, generate tests, review code, manage the ticket board, and run a retrospective. |

An agent and its skills are two ways into the same work: a skill run directly does the job, and an agent adds a guide who knows the whole phase. `bmad-party-mode` brings the agents together in one discussion and offers the `product-team` room.

## After a skill finishes

| Just finished | Offer next |
|---|---|
| `bmad-product-brief`, `bmad-prfaq` | `bmad-spec` with the result as input. `bmad-prd` first when the requirements still need drawing out. After a PRFAQ verdict with serious gaps, address those before anything else. |
| `bmad-prd` | `bmad-spec` to absorb it. `bmad-ux` when the UI matters; `bmad-architecture` when parts must fit together. |
| `bmad-ux` | `bmad-spec` to adopt the files as companions. When UX came first and requirements are still thin, `bmad-prd` or the lighter `bmad-product-brief` with the UX files as input. |
| `bmad-architecture` | `bmad-spec` to adopt the spine as a companion. |
| `bmad-spec` | Its open questions and assumptions, if any. Then `bmad-ticket` with the spec folder to plan the stories, and `bmad-build` per story, or straight to `bmad-build` when one session can do it. |
| `bmad-build` | Open a PR, or `bmad-walkthrough` when a person wants to understand the change. Once the user marks the ticket done, the next ticket. `bmad-qa-generate-e2e-tests` when end-to-end coverage is wanted. |
| The last ticket of an epic | `bmad-retrospective`, then a refactoring pass over the whole changeset, which is commonly skipped (`help/preparing-a-repo-for-agents.md`). Then close the epic through `bmad-ticket` and retain its plans (`help/artifact-lifetime.md`). |

## Answering "what's next?"

Read the state before recommending: which of the outputs named above exist, and what the codebase, git history, and the user say is done. A file's presence, or a plan with `status: done`, is evidence the skill ran, not proof the work is finished or current.

- Mid-path, recommend the next unfinished step of the route the user is on, not a restart, and migrate legacy artifacts before resuming them.
- When a significant change surfaces, route it as the table in "Match the situation" says, then resume at the earliest affected step. Do not replay unaffected work.
- The work is complete when the intent is satisfied, its chosen checks pass, and no chosen review leaves material findings open — not when every skill has run.

## When this document is not enough

For a `method` question this document, its topic files, and the installed skills cannot answer, fetch the documentation site at `https://docs.bmad-method.org/` and follow the pages relevant to the question. The source repository it links to is the final authority on how anything actually behaves.
