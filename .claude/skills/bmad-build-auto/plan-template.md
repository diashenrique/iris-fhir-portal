<!-- Target: 900–1300 tokens (less if route is oneshot). Above 1600 = high risk of context rot;
     add `oversized` to frontmatter `warnings` and continue.
     Never over-specify "how" — use boundaries + examples instead.
     Cohesive cross-layer changes (DB+BE+UI) stay in ONE file.
     IMPORTANT: Remove all HTML comments when filling this template. -->

<intent-contract>

## Intent

<!-- What is broken or missing, and why it matters. Then the high-level approach — the "what", not the "how". -->

**Problem:** ONE_TO_TWO_SENTENCES

**Approach:** ONE_TO_TWO_SENTENCES

## Boundaries & Constraints

<!-- Two tiers: Always = invariant rules. Never = out of scope + forbidden approaches.
     Delete this section if route is oneshot. -->

**Always:** INVARIANT_RULES

**Never:** NON_GOALS_AND_FORBIDDEN_APPROACHES

## I/O & Edge-Case Matrix

<!-- If no meaningful I/O scenarios exist, delete this section. Do not write "N/A" or "None".
     Delete this section if route is oneshot. -->

| Scenario | Input / State | Expected Output / Behavior | Error Handling |
|----------|--------------|---------------------------|----------------|
| HAPPY_PATH | INPUT | OUTCOME | No error expected |
| ERROR_CASE | INPUT | OUTCOME | ERROR_HANDLING |

## Code Map

<!-- Agent-populated during planning. Annotated paths prevent blind codebase searching.
     Delete this section if route is oneshot. -->

- `FILE` -- ROLE_OR_RELEVANCE
- `FILE` -- ROLE_OR_RELEVANCE

## Tasks & Acceptance

<!-- Tasks: backtick-quoted file path -- action -- rationale. Prefer one task per file; group tightly-coupled changes when splitting would be artificial. -->
<!-- If an I/O Matrix is present, include a task to unit-test its edge cases. -->
<!-- AC covers system-level behaviors not captured by the I/O Matrix. Do not duplicate I/O scenarios here. -->
<!-- Delete this section if route is oneshot. -->

**Execution:**
- [ ] `FILE` -- ACTION -- RATIONALE

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given PRECONDITION, when ACTION, then EXPECTED_RESULT

## Implementation Notes

<!-- Agent-owned. Append-only during implementation: decisions made, files touched, surprises
     encountered. Never delete this section. Leave empty at planning time, except on the
     oneshot route: start with a short explanation of why. -->

## Plan Change Log

<!-- Append-only. Populated by step-04 during review loops. Do not modify or delete existing entries.
     Each entry records: what finding triggered the change, what was amended, what known-bad state
     the amendment avoids, and any KEEP instructions (what worked well and must survive re-derivation).
     Empty until the first bad_plan loopback. -->

## Review Triage Log

<!-- Append-only. Populated by step-04 on EVERY review pass, including loopbacks and blocked exits.
     Each entry records verdict counts (high/medium/low/false/maybe-false) and one row per
     reviewer finding: verdict, route, and evidence — the refutation for false, what would settle
     it for maybe-false, the action taken for patches. Empty until the first review pass. -->

## Design Notes

<!-- If the approach is straightforward, delete this section. Do not write "N/A" or "None".
     Delete this section if route is oneshot. -->
<!-- Design rationale and golden examples only when non-obvious. Keep examples to 5–10 lines. -->

DESIGN_RATIONALE_AND_EXAMPLES

## Verification

<!-- If no build, test, or lint commands apply, delete this section. Do not write "N/A" or "None". -->
<!-- How the agent confirms its own work. Prefer CLI commands. When no CLI check applies, state what to inspect manually. -->

**Commands:**
- `COMMAND` -- expected: SUCCESS_CRITERIA

**Manual checks (if no CLI):**
- WHAT_TO_INSPECT_AND_EXPECTED_STATE
