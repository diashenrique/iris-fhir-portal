"""Check every skills/*/bmod.toml against the runtime that has to read it.

This file owns the repository checks: pre-commit and CI run it, and stamp_release.py beside it imports
`check_repo` and `stamp_text` from it. Keys and tables the runtime does not know are left alone.
It ships with the `bmad` skill, so any module repository can run it against its own tree.

Usage:
  uv run skills/bmad/scripts/validate_manifests.py [--project-root <path>]
